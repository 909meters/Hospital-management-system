# Hospital Management System API Testing Results

## ✅ SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED

Complete setup and testing of the Hospital Management System API has been successfully completed. All components are working correctly.

## 🔧 Completed Tasks

### 1. Authentication Setup
- ✅ Configured TokenAuthentication in settings.py
- ✅ Added custom views for token retrieval
- ✅ Created endpoints for login/logout/profile
- ✅ Configured access permissions (IsAuthenticated)

### 2. Token Management
- ✅ Created Django command for generating tokens for existing users
- ✅ Tokens are automatically generated when creating new users

### 3. Patient API
- ✅ Configured ViewSets for patients
- ✅ Implemented patient creation logic with automatic user creation
- ✅ Fixed username duplication issues
- ✅ Configured access permissions (patients see only themselves, doctors see all)

### 4. Testing and Documentation
- ✅ Created Python script for automatic API testing
- ✅ Created Postman collection with ready-to-use requests
- ✅ Created Postman environment with variables
- ✅ Written detailed API usage instructions

## 📊 Testing Results

### Test Users
- **testuser** (PATIENT): password `testuser123`
- **testdoctor** (DOCTOR): password `testdoc123`

### Successful Tests
1. **Token Retrieval**: ✅ Working
2. **Profile Access**: ✅ Working
3. **Patient List**: ✅ Working (with access permissions)
4. **Patient Creation**: ✅ Working (with automatic user creation)

### Example of Successful Patient Creation
```json
{
  "user_id": 9,
  "full_name": "Test-kd00gw Patient",
  "date_of_birth": "1990-01-01",
  "address": "Test address kd00gw",
  "phone_number": "+7 (999) 999-90-19"
}
```

## 🔗 Available Endpoints
