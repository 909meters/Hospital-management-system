## 🧪 Pre-Demo Testing Checklist

### System Startup Verification
```powershell
# 1. Start the system
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d

# 2. Verify all services are running
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml ps

# 3. Check logs for errors
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml logs

# 4. Test frontend access
# Open http://localhost:8501

# 5. Test API access  
# Check http://localhost:8000/api/

# 6. Verify test data
# Login with test credentials
```

### Demo Flow Verification
1. **Authentication Demo**: Login as different roles (admin, doctor, patient)
2. **Patient Management**: Create, view, update patient records
3. **Appointment Booking**: Schedule and manage appointments
4. **Role-Based Access**: Demonstrate permission differences
5. **API Endpoints**: Show Postman collection in action
6. **Architecture**: Walk through technical diagrams
7. **Performance**: Show response time metrics

### Presentation Material Check
