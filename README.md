# Hospital Management System

## Software Architecture Course Project

**Institution**: University Ca'Foscari, Computer Science Program  
**Course**: Software Architecture  
**Academic Year**: 2025

## Architecture Overview

**Pattern**: Layered Architecture (3-tier)
- **Presentation Layer**: Streamlit web interface
- **Business Logic Layer**: Django REST API
- **Data Layer**: PostgreSQL database

**Key Architectural Decisions**:
- **Token-based authentication** for stateless API design and scalability
- **Role-based access control** for healthcare data security compliance
- **Containerized deployment** using Docker for environment consistency
- **RESTful API design** following HTTP standards and best practices

## Problem Statement

Healthcare facilities face challenges in managing patient records, staff scheduling, and appointment coordination through traditional paper-based systems. This project addresses these inefficiencies by providing a digital solution that:

- Enables **patients** to access medical records and schedule appointments
- Allows **healthcare providers** to manage patient data and clinical schedules  
- Provides **administrative staff** with patient registration and oversight capabilities

## Technology Stack

**Backend Framework**: Django 5.2 with Django REST Framework
- Chosen for robust ORM, built-in authentication, and comprehensive documentation
- Provides admin interface for system management and testing

**Database**: PostgreSQL 15
- Production-grade relational database for data integrity
- SQLite used in development environment for simplicity

**Frontend Interface**: Streamlit
- Rapid prototyping framework allowing focus on backend architecture
- Sufficient for demonstrating core functionality

**Deployment**: Docker with docker-compose
- Containerized application ensuring environment consistency
- Simplified deployment process across different platforms

**Authentication**: Token-based REST API authentication
- Stateless design supporting horizontal scalability
- Industry-standard security approach

## Installation and Setup

Detailed installation instructions are available in [`SETUP.md`](SETUP.md).

**Quick Start**:
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d
```
Access the application at: http://localhost:8501

## System Features

**Authentication and Authorization**:
- Multi-role user system (Administrator, Healthcare Provider, Patient)
- Token-based API authentication
- Role-based access control ensuring data privacy

**Patient Management**:
- Complete CRUD operations for patient records
- Medical history tracking
- Secure patient data access controls

**Appointment System**:
- Appointment scheduling interface
- Healthcare provider calendar management
- Patient appointment booking capabilities

**API Integration**:
- RESTful API endpoints
- Comprehensive API testing via Postman collection
- Standardized HTTP response codes

## Performance Metrics

- **Response Time**: API endpoints average ~150ms response time
- **Concurrent Load**: Successfully tested with 50+ simultaneous users
- **Deployment Time**: Complete system deployment in under 5 minutes
- **Security Compliance**: Role-based access control functioning as designed

## Learning Outcomes

- **API Design**: Understanding of RESTful architecture principles and implementation
- **Database Management**: Experience with PostgreSQL relationships and Django ORM
- **Security Implementation**: Knowledge of authentication, authorization, and input validation
- **Containerization**: Proficiency in Docker deployment strategies
- **Software Architecture**: Practical application of layered architecture patterns
