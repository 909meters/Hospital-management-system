# Software Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

## Overview
This document contains the key architectural decisions made during the development of the Hospital Management System, following the ADR (Architecture Decision Record) format.

## ADR-001: Use Django REST Framework for Backend API

**Date**: 2025-08-24  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Deciders**: Development Team  

### Context
We need a robust backend framework for creating RESTful APIs to handle patient data, authentication, and scheduling functionality.

### Decision
Use Django REST Framework (DRF) as the primary backend technology.

### Rationale
- **Rapid Development**: DRF provides built-in serializers, viewsets, and authentication
- **Security**: Built-in protection against common vulnerabilities (CSRF, SQL injection)
- **Scalability**: Support for pagination, filtering, and query optimization
- **Community**: Large ecosystem and extensive documentation
- **Medical Standards**: Django's ORM supports complex relationships needed for medical records

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Fast development, robust security, excellent documentation
- **Negative**: Learning curve for team members unfamiliar with Django
- **Risks**: Framework lock-in, need to keep up with Django updates

## ADR-002: Implement Token-Based Authentication

**Date**: 2025-08-24  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Deciders**: Security Team, Development Team  

### Context
Medical data requires secure authentication and authorization mechanisms compliant with healthcare standards.

### Decision
Implement token-based authentication using Django REST Framework's TokenAuthentication.

### Rationale
- **Stateless**: Supports horizontal scaling without session storage
- **Security**: Tokens can be easily revoked and have controlled lifetimes
- **API-First**: Perfect for REST API consumption by frontend applications
- **Compliance**: Supports audit trails and access logging required for medical systems

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Stateless architecture, easy to implement, secure
- **Negative**: Tokens need proper storage and management on client side
- **Risks**: Token theft if not properly secured in transport

## ADR-003: Use Streamlit for Frontend (Low-Code Approach)

**Date**: 2025-08-24  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Deciders**: Development Team, Product Owner  

### Context
Need a frontend solution that allows rapid development with minimal frontend expertise, focusing on functionality over complex UI.

### Decision
Use Streamlit as the primary frontend technology.

### Rationale
- **Rapid Prototyping**: Quick development of functional interfaces
- **Python Ecosystem**: Consistent technology stack with backend
- **Medical Focus**: Suitable for data-driven healthcare applications
- **Low Maintenance**: Minimal JavaScript/CSS complexity
- **Integration**: Easy API consumption and data visualization

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Fast development, consistent tech stack, easy maintenance
- **Negative**: Limited UI customization, less suitable for complex interactions
- **Risks**: May need replacement for production-scale UI requirements

## ADR-004: Choose PostgreSQL for Production Database

**Date**: 2025-08-24  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Deciders**: Development Team, DBA  

### Context
Need a production-ready database that can handle medical data with ACID compliance and good performance.

### Decision
Use PostgreSQL as the primary database for production environments.

### Rationale
- **ACID Compliance**: Critical for medical data integrity
- **Performance**: Excellent query optimization and indexing capabilities
- **JSON Support**: Flexible storage for varying medical record formats
- **Backup & Recovery**: Robust backup and point-in-time recovery features
- **Compliance**: Supports healthcare data requirements and audit trails

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Enterprise-grade reliability, excellent performance, feature-rich
- **Negative**: More complex setup compared to SQLite
- **Risks**: Need for database administration expertise

## ADR-005: Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

**Date**: 2025-08-24  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Deciders**: Security Team, Product Owner  

### Context
Healthcare systems require strict access control to ensure patient data privacy and comply with regulations like HIPAA.

### Decision
Implement a role-based access control system with three primary roles: PATIENT, DOCTOR, and ADMIN.

### Rationale
- **Compliance**: Meets healthcare data privacy requirements
- **Security**: Principle of least privilege access
- **Flexibility**: Easy to extend with additional roles as needed
- **Audit**: Clear access patterns for security auditing

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Strong security model, regulatory compliance, clear authorization patterns
- **Negative**: Added complexity in permission management
- **Risks**: Over-restrictive permissions may impact usability

## ADR-006: Use Docker for Containerization and Deployment

**Date**: 2025-08-24  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Deciders**: DevOps Team, Development Team  

### Context
Need consistent deployment across different environments (development, staging, production) with easy scalability.

### Decision
Containerize the entire application stack using Docker and Docker Compose.

### Rationale
- **Consistency**: Identical environments across dev/staging/production
- **Scalability**: Easy horizontal scaling with container orchestration
- **Deployment**: Simplified deployment process and rollbacks
- **Isolation**: Service isolation and dependency management
- **Cloud Ready**: Compatible with modern cloud deployment strategies

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Consistent deployments, easy scaling, cloud-native approach
- **Negative**: Additional complexity in local development setup
- **Risks**: Container security considerations, need for container expertise

## ADR-007: Implement Layered Architecture Pattern

**Date**: 2025-08-24  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Deciders**: Architecture Team  

### Context
Need a clear architectural pattern that separates concerns and supports maintainability and testing.

### Decision
Implement a layered architecture with distinct presentation, business logic, and data layers.

### Rationale
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between different system responsibilities
- **Testability**: Easy to unit test individual layers
- **Maintainability**: Changes in one layer don't affect others
- **Team Organization**: Different teams can work on different layers

### Architecture Layers:
1. **Presentation Layer**: Streamlit frontend
2. **API Layer**: Django REST Framework
3. **Business Logic Layer**: Django models and services
4. **Data Layer**: PostgreSQL with Django ORM

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Clear architecture, good separation of concerns, testable
- **Negative**: May introduce unnecessary abstraction for simple operations
- **Risks**: Over-engineering for small applications
