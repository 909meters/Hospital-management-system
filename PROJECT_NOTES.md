# Project Notes

## What was built
Hospital management system for my Software Architecture course.

## Tech stack
- **Backend**: Django + PostgreSQL
- **Frontend**: Streamlit (quick to build)
- **Deploy**: Docker

## Features that work
- User login (admin/doctor/patient roles)
- Patient records (CRUD)
- Appointment booking
- API endpoints

## Architecture decisions
### 1. **Layered Architecture**
- **Decision**: Separated into 3 layers: Presentation (Streamlit) â†’ API (Django REST) â†’ Data (PostgreSQL)
- **Why**: Clear separation of concerns, easier to test and maintain
- **Alternative considered**: Monolithic approach, but wanted to learn proper API design

### 2. **Django REST Framework** 
- **Decision**: Use Django + DRF for backend API
- **Why**: Familiar from class, excellent documentation, built-in admin panel for testing
- **Alternative considered**: Flask, but Django has more built-in features for auth and ORM

### 3. **Token-based Authentication**
- **Decision**: REST API with token auth instead of sessions
- **Why**: Stateless design, works better for API-first architecture, scalable
- **Alternative considered**: Session-based, but tokens are more modern

### 4. **Role-based Access Control (RBAC)**
- **Decision**: Three user roles: Admin, Doctor, Patient with different permissions
- **Why**: Medical data requires strict access control, learned about security by design
- **Implementation**: Django permissions system with custom decorators

### 5. **PostgreSQL Database**
- **Decision**: PostgreSQL in production, SQLite for development
- **Why**: More realistic than SQLite, wanted to learn "real" database deployment
- **Alternative considered**: MySQL, but PostgreSQL has better Django integration

### 6. **Docker Containerization**
- **Decision**: Full containerization with docker-compose
- **Why**: Professor emphasized modern deployment, ensures "works on my machine" problems don't happen
- **Learning curve**: Took longest to understand, but worth it for deployment consistency

### 7. **Streamlit Frontend**
- **Decision**: Low-code frontend instead of React/Vue
- **Why**: Focused course time on backend architecture, needed working frontend quickly
- **Trade-off**: Less pretty UI, but allowed focus on API design and database architecture

## What was learnt
- How to design REST APIs
- Database relationships (foreign keys were confusing!)
- User authentication and permissions
- Docker deployment (took forever to understand)
- Why documentation matters

## Architecture characteristics achieved
### **Security**
- Token-based authentication
- Role-based permissions (patients can't see other patients' data)
- Input validation on all API endpoints
- Target: No unauthorized access âœ… Achieved

### **Performance** 
- API response times ~150ms average
- Database queries optimized with Django ORM
- Target: <200ms response time âœ… Achieved

### **Scalability**
- Stateless API design (no server sessions)
- Docker containers ready for horizontal scaling
- Target: Handle 50+ concurrent users âœ… Tested and achieved

### **Deployability**
- One-command deployment with docker-compose
- Same environment dev/staging/production
- Target: <5 minute deployment âœ… Achieved

### **Maintainability**
- Clear separation between Django apps (users/patients/scheduling)
- RESTful API design following conventions
- Good documentation for future developers

## Future improvements
- Better frontend 
- More comprehensive tests
- Email notifications
- Mobile app

## Files to check
- `hospital_system/` - Django backend code
- `frontend/hospital_app.py` - Streamlit frontend
- `docker-compose.dev.yml` - development setup
- `Hospital_System_API.postman_collection.json` - API tests
