### ‚úÖ Reliability
- **Requirement**: Data integrity and backup mechanisms
- **Implementation**:
  - PostgreSQL ACID compliance
  - Docker volume-based data persistence
  - Database constraints and validations
  - Automated health checks for all services

### ‚úÖ Deployability
- **Requirement**: Containerized deployment via Docker for easy replication and environment setup
- **Implementation**:
  - Multi-container Docker Compose setup
  - Separate development and production configurations
  - Environment variable configuration
  - Automated startup scripts

### ‚úÖ Scalability
- **Requirement**: System must handle increasing user load without performance degradation
